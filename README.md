# Moodle_mfa_user_check
Forced redirection for MFA setup


The status of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for the user is checked, based on the settings of the "tool_mfa" plugin.

1. **MFA Status Check:**
   - If MFA is not enabled (i.e., the "tool_mfa | enabled" plugin is disabled), the MFA User Check plugin (local_mfa_user_check) will be set to **Disabled**.
   - If MFA is enabled (i.e., the "tool_mfa | enabled" plugin is active), the MFA User Check plugin will remain in a **pending** state, awaiting the administrator to enable the MFA function as part of the user check process (Enabled MFA User Check - local_mfa_user_check).

   **Note:** If MFA "tool_mfa | enabled" is disabled, the MFA User Check plugin (local_mfa_user_check) will automatically switch to the **Disabled** state.

2. **Hiding Settings:**
   - If MFA is not enabled, the associated settings will be hidden from the administrator.

3. **User Permission Check:**
   - The system checks if the user has the necessary permissions to access the MFA preferences administration page (/admin/tool/mfa/user_preferences.php):
     - If the user has the required permissions, they will be redirected to the MFA administration page.
     - If the user does not have the necessary permissions, they will be redirected to the user preferences page.

Thus, the process ensures that MFA settings are properly managed and only accessible to users with the appropriate permissions.
